                        <p>This is my first game that I made when I was first messing
                            around with Unity and just trying to make a functional game.
                            It is very basic with no sounds and no music and only 5 levels.
                            <br>
                            Looking back I would change a lot but I am proud of it as it 
                            is my first ever game that I made with close to no knowledge of 
                            how to code. <br>

                    <p>This is a project that we did in college, where we were put into groups and made games for the Godot Wild Jam #62. 
                        I mainly focused on the programming side of the game. It is a Doom-like wave survival game.
                        I am very happy with how it turned out. The story of the game is that you play as a 
                        living apple and you need to protect your boss who lives in a giant pumpkin while being attacked
                        by giant squirrels and you only weapon is throwing apples at them (Until layer where you unlock anoh
                        another weapon but you have to play it to find out what it is).
                        Overall the game came out pretty good there are a few things that we could improve like variety of enemies but
                        as we are still learning I think we did a really good job.
